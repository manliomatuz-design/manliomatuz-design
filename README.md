## About Me

I come from a background in Communication Sciences, where I developed a deep understanding of human behavior, messaging, and the psychology behind effective communication. This foundation naturally led me to discover my passion for UI/UX Design—a field where I can blend strategic thinking with creative problem-solving to craft user-centered digital experiences.

My transition into UX has been driven by curiosity and a commitment to understanding users at every level. I'm passionate about usability research, information architecture, and creating intuitive interfaces that solve real problems. Whether it's conducting user interviews, building wireframes, or iterating on prototypes based on feedback, I thrive on turning insights into actionable design solutions.

I approach every project with a growth mindset, constantly learning and refining my process. I believe great design is invisible—it anticipates needs, reduces friction, and enhances experiences without drawing attention to itself.
