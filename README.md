## About Me

I come from a background in Communication Sciences, where I developed a deep understanding of human behavior, messaging, and the psychology behind effective communication. This foundation naturally led me to discover my passion for UI/UX Design—a field where I can blend strategic thinking with creative problem-solving to craft user-centered digital experiences.

My transition into UX has been driven by curiosity and a commitment to understanding users at every level. I'm passionate about usability research, information architecture, and creating intuitive interfaces that solve real problems. Whether it's conducting user interviews, building wireframes, or iterating on prototypes based on feedback, I thrive on turning insights into actionable design solutions.

I approach every project with a growth mindset, constantly learning and refining my process. I believe great design is invisible—it anticipates needs, reduces friction, and enhances experiences without drawing attention to itself.

## Experience

### End-to-End Product Design Project
*Comprehensive UI/UX project developed as part of an intensive design course, focused on building digital products from concept to high-fidelity prototype.*

The project simulated a real-world client scenario, covering the complete product design lifecycle from initial ideation to presentation-ready deliverables.

**Overview**  
This project involved designing a website or application starting from scratch, applying structured design methodologies and user-centered principles throughout every stage of the process.

**Process**
- Conducted early-stage ideation and concept definition
- Developed low-fidelity sketches and wireframes to explore layout and structure
- Generated design inspiration individually, collaboratively, and with AI-assisted tools
- Transitioned into mid-fidelity wireframes with refined hierarchy and interaction clarity
- Built high-fidelity UI designs aligned with modern design standards
- Created interactive prototypes with responsive behaviors to simulate real product functionality
